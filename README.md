## Sentence Reconstruction with Transformer Model

- **Description:** Developed for the Deep Learning course at Alma Mater Studiorum - UniversitÃ  di Bologna, this goal of this project is to create a model which is able to reconstruct original English sentences from shuffeld version of this sentence using a Transformer model. The transformer iteratively predicts one token at a time, using the generated sequence as the decoder input for the next prediction. This project exemplifies the practical application of deep learning techniques in natural language processing.
- **Time Frame:** June 2024 â€“ June 2024
- **GitHub Link:** [Sentence Reconstruction with Transformer Model](https://github.com/lyudmilstamenov/deep_learning_unibo)
- **Languages/Technologies Used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

## Password Manager

- **Description:** I built a Python console application designed to securely store and manage user account credentials. The app features
robust encryption to protect passwords and offers additional functionalities, including the creation of organizations,
password generation and categorization of accounts. Users have the ability to create individual accounts, as well as
organizations to which they can invite other users for shared access to accounts. All information is securely stored in
Google Cloud Platformâ€™s Datastore.
- **Time Frame:** December 2022 â€“ January 2022
- **GitHub Link:** [Password Manager](https://github.com/lyudmilstamenov/password_manager)
- **Languages/Technologies Used:** Python, Conda, GCP Datastore

## Image Classifier on CIFAR-10

- **Description:** I conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms with effective feature extraction on complex datasets, such as CIFAR-10. To achieve this, I tested and fine-tuned multiple algorithms, and preprocessed the data using edge detection filters and PCA. Additionally, I used various ensemble methods to enhance the overall performance of the algorithms. As a result, I compared the results of the optimized algorithms to those of a thin CNN.
- **Time Frame:** December 2022 - January 2022
- **GitHub Link:** [Image Classifier on CIFAR-10](https://github.com/lyudmilstamenov/cifar-10-ml-algorithms)
- **Languages/Technologies Used:** Python, Conda, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, Google Colab

## Scala Weather Bot

- **Description:** As part of an elective course at university, I developed a console application in Scala that provides various weather and
sports-related information. The application offers functionalities such as retrieving the current weather, forecasting,
astronomy details by city and date, football matches for the day and timezone by city. In addition, it stores all user
requests in an Excel document, and allows users to view and delete their search history. The project demonstrates my
ability to develop a functional application using Scala and to integrate it with Excel.
- **Time Frame:** June 2022 -- July 2022
- **GitHub Link:** [Scala Weather Bot](https://github.com/lyudmilstamenov/scala-weather-bot)
- **Languages/Technologies Used:** Scala

## Uber Dellivery

- **Description:**
   - As part of my summer practice at Uber, my team developed a robust and scalable delivery web application, utilizing Java (Spring Boot) for the backend and JavaScript (React) for the frontend. I integrated app with the Google Maps API to enhance the user interface and added reverse geocoding functionality to accurately determine locations.
   - The API was seamlessly integrated with the database using Hibernate, with MySQL serving as the database management system. The application was deployed on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, ensuring maximum availability and reliability.
- **Time Frame:** August 2021 -- September 2021
- **GitHub Link:** [Uber Dellivery](https://github.com/orgs/uber-summer-practice-sofia-2021/repositories)
- **Languages/Technologies Used:** Java, Spring, Java Script, React

## Finite Automatons

- **Description:** Created a console application which provides the user with basic operations with deterministic and nondeterministic automatons. The programme also works with regular expressions and parses them to automatons and vice versa.
- **Time Frame:** December 2020 -- January 2021
- **GitHub Link:** [Finite Automatons](https://github.com/lyudmilstamenov/Finite-Automatons)
- **Languages/Technologies Used:** C++, VS Code
