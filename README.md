## Password Manager

- **Description:** I built a Python console application designed to securely store and manage user account credentials. The app features
robust encryption to protect passwords and offers additional functionalities, including the creation of organizations,
password generation and categorization of accounts. Users have the ability to create individual accounts, as well as
organizations to which they can invite other users for shared access to accounts. All information is securely stored in
Google Cloud Platform’s Datastore.
